My current website for the Dev.Catalyst competition

GeoJackson README
*****************
Geocaching is a fun and adventerous high tech scavenger hunt that millions of people around the world participate in every day.

We are very avid geocachers in the Jackson area, and hope to spread news about the GeoJackson club. As members and supporters, we wanted to create a website that explains exactly what the group is and our goal to better the local community.


Website:

-We spoke with the leader of GeoJackson, who was very excited to see how this project world turn out. She wanted a very sleek and simple website with a good amount of information about the club.

-Our main goal was to create a clean, modern website that people of all ages and tech backgrounds would be able to navigate easily.  

-We originally only started with a simple css boilerplate known as Skeleton, which was not designed to be a framework (we did that on our own!). This allowed us to have a good starting point while still being able to create and customize our website the way we wanted.

-Geocaching is known for being very earth-friendly, and we wanted to make sure that idea was conveyed. We have many picture of trees, nature, and other outdoorsy elements. 

-We wanted a color scheme that fit with the message of the website and that provided contrast for the text. We chose the official geocaching green as our main color to go along with our black, white, and grey.

-We spent most of out time dealing with layouts and trying to find solutions that are easy to read, pleasing, and clean. We didn't want to have anyting too extravagant that stole attention away from the overall goal of the website - to inform others.

-Because Skeleton is such a simple boilerplate, we were able to make the website our own. We took inspiration from websites like TeamTreehouse and theCo, becuase they're both very clean and modern while still conveying plenty of information.

-Making this website responsive was a little challenging, but due to our Skeleton css markup, we were able to get it as responsive as possible, with some minor issues here and there on awkward screen sizes.

-We tried to make sure our code was very organized and easy to understand, making future changes to the site very quick and easy.

-We wanted to make the website easy to understand, so we tried to make it clear to see what page you're on in the header.

-We knew that we needed a logo that we could use throughout the website, so we created the logo that you see in the top left. We wanted something that fit the club's focus on nature and the outdoors, so we chose a tree.

-We added navigation to the footer to make it easy to navigate around the page. However, since there are eight pages, we chose to remove this on mobile screens so it doesn't look crowded.

-We also added links to social media and the email to make it easy for people to connect with the club.



Home Page:

-This is the first thing people see when they come to the site, so we wanted to make sure to leave a good first impression. 


-We chose to do a very simple home page that included a banner we took from an official Geocaching YouTube video. It is very naturesque and it fits the theme of our site.

-We chose a two column layout with a larger column on top to make things easy to read. This draws people's attention to the most important information while still allowing us to have some extra information included.

-We chose a white base with black or dark green text color to have good contrast. We chose the font Raleway because it is modern, crisp, and readable.

-In the bottom right of the body, we added a picture and a link to the original Geocaching website. We would like to be as involved as possible with the actual application.



What is Geocaching? Page:

-We added the YouTube video to make sure that people could easily get the main idea of what Geocaching is.

-To help fill in the page, we went with a two column layout and added some fun facts beside the video. 

-We wanted to add some additional information without trying to squish everything into a three column layout, so we chose to have a wide column on the bottom where we could put some more text explaining Geocaching.



About Us Page:

-We kept with the two column layout because we felt it was easy to read and gave all of the content room to breathe. 

-We added the picture on the right of the page to help fill in some of the white space and to make sure that the page wasn't just one big block of text.

-We added a FAQ to the bottom using an accordion menu. This allowed us to answer a varity of questions without overcrowding the page.



Mission Page :

-On this page, we explain that our goal as a community is to be accepting towards all people and to create a safe enviorment for kids of all ages, parents, and our seniors. We also go into depth about the rules of GeoJackson.

-We wanted to make the layout of this page interesting but not overly complicated. We chose tile pattern because it's easy to read while still looking nice.

-We made sure that everything was still readable on smaller screens by having it go to one column.
 


Join Page:

-Keeping with the overall theme of the website, we wanted this page to look clean and simple while still conveying all the necessary information.

-We added a php formed linked to the GeoJackson email address so users can become members easily.

-Here, we also have our rank system. Much like Girl Scouts, GeoJackson has a way to identify who you are by how many caches you have.

-We wanted to make sure the ranks were easy to read and understand, so we created logos for each rank and added a small amount of text for each rank.



Events Page:

-This page posed a bit of a challenge, as we needed a way to clearly convey the schedule that would be easy for everyone to understand.

-We tried several imbedded calendars, but eventually chose to just do a simple grid showing the calendars for four months.



Team Page:

-On this page we have pictures of the main leaders of GeoJackson, including us. We wanted to ask for quotes and more information about the others but sadly ran out of time. We hope to be able to in the future if needed.

-The layout of the body was a little complicated to figure out, but we wanted something more fun and diverse on our pages.

-The display is also very responsive and goes into one column when on smaller devices.



Gallery Page:

-This is our favorite page! We went and took many pictues of our caches and finds and put them in one place! 

-The slideshow was made with javascript using our pictures from hikes in the mountains. It was very simple to add and it adds a lovely touch to the gallery. It is also responsive on mobile.

-We chose a three column layout on large screen so that the pictures weren't too big and so that everything looks balanced. On smaller screens, this goes down to two columns and then one column for mobile.

-The gallery has a hover on it to see some text explaining the pictures. They all flow togeher and tell a story so please be sure to view them all!



We both worked very hard and diligently to have this website be the way it is. We await your criticism and hope that you enjoyed this tour of the GeoJackson website!
